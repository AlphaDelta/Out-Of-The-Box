# Out Of The Box

Out Of The Box is a multi-tool for Windows.

The way it works is modules are created as Form objects in the Module namespace, when the entry Form (Main) is loaded it reflects itself then iterates through all of the types and finds the modules. From there the modules are added to a ListView so that the user may start a module by double clicking on it in the list.

Currently it is in development and should be considered unstable.
